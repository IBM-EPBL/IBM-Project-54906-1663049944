                <b>NAMASTE!!</b><br><br>
                Hello aspiring and thirsty minds!! <br><br>
                <b>"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to save the world"</b>
				<i>-Nelson Mandela</i><br><br>
                <b>"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today"</b><br><br>

                University education is becoming the critical pillar of social and economic life in this twenty-first century. 
                Predicting university entrance and the eligibility criteria for admissions, on the other hand might be challenging because pupils
                are unaware of the admission standards.<br><br>
                To help the students to know whether they are eligible to get an admission in the university and in the department 
                they wish, our team has come up with the idea where the pupils give their academic profile, their preferred location,
                their preferred department and the university. Our Machine Learning model will analyse the input and predict whether the pupil
                is eligible to get an admission in the university and also provides with other universities that the student can get admitted.
                <br><br>
                To make it easier for the student to know about the universities that the pupil is eligible we are providing 
                them with the direct link to the university website and the location link.<br><br>
                We hope that the thirst of the pupils who seek an admission in an university is quenched with the help of our model.<br><br>
                <i>We wish you all a great future!!!</i><br><br>
